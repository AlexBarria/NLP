Vectorize documents using one hot encoding, frequency vectors and TF-IDF. Develop a function that receive the corpus and the document id and return the documents sorted by the cosine similarity.


## Assignment II: bot_dnn_spacy

In this assesment i used a bot developed using NLTK as a sentimen analyser. I downloaded a dataset from internet of different tweets and used for train a classifier. The bot recive a sentense and determine if the user are happy or sad.

## Assignment III: Custom embedding con Gensim

Create embeddings using a dataset of songs from an specific artist. Exploring the embeddings we can see how the words from the same song are related.

## Assignment IV: Next word prediction

The objective of this assesment is to create embeddings using some document, in this case, a chapter of lord of the rings. For this pourpose i used thats embbedings in add with LSTM layers to predict next word.

## Assignment V:  clothing_ecommerce_reviews

<img src="https://github.com/AlexBarria/NLP/blob/main/Images/rating.jpg" width="200" height="100">

The objective of this assessment is to create embeddings using seller's reviews to determine the rating that the sellers gives to some product. In this solution, LSTM neral network architecture were used too.

## Assignment VI:  QA bot

In this assessment i used data available from convai of conversations in english to build a QA bot.
